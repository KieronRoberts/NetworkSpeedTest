## Overview

The Network Speed Test Application is a simple and efficient tool designed to measure the upload and download speeds of your internet connection. By leveraging this application, users can easily determine their network performance and identify any issues related to bandwidth and connectivity. The application performs speed tests by sending and receiving data packets to and from a remote server, providing users with real-time results and detailed metrics.
